## What is Speedway?
Speedway is a suite of developer tools that allow you to create, update, deprecate and query schemas, objects and buckets on the Sonr Network. The Speedway Suite consists of the Speedway CLI, the Speedway API, and the Speedway UI which is a web application that allows you to interact with the Speedway API.

Speedway currently utilizes four modules on the Sonr Blockchain. The modules are listed below for a wholistic overview.
- [Registry Documentation](/docs/highway/modules/registry.md)
- [Schema Documentation](/docs/highway/modules/schemas.md)
- [Object Documentation](/docs/highway/modules/objects.md)
- [Bucket Documentation](/docs/highway/modules/buckets.md)

## Installation
The Speedway CLI allows developers all the comforts of Speedway into a command-line interface. Speedway User-Interface gives developers the ability to visually create schemas, objects and buckets in a web application.

- [Speedway Web](/docs/speedway/installation.md)

### Next Steps
The Speedway API was created in tandom with the Speedway UI to give developers the ability to utilize the Speedway suite in a web application.
