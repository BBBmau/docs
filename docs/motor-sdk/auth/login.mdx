## Logging in to an Account

If your user has previously created an account on the device, they can log in without a password. Alternatively, if the user's preshared key has been added to the device, they may login with a password.

:::note

Users must be authenticated in order to utilize other Motor features. For more information on how authentication works on Sonr, see [TODO](#)
