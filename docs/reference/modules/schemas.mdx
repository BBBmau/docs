The Sonr Schema module is used to store the records of verifiable objects for a specific application powered by the Sonr Network. Schemas are used to create custom application protocols which can be asserted on in order to verify your application data. Application data uploaded can verify their data model through `Schemas`.

## Overview

Schemas are implemented on the `IPLD Object Model` which allows developers to register specific application data schemas. See [IPLD Schema documentation](https://ipld.io/docs/schemas)

## Concepts

### What Is records

A `WhatIs` record holds an instance of `SchemaDefinition`. This document holds all metadata and relationships for the `Schema` created

```go
message WhatIs {
  // DID is the DID of the object
  string did

  // Object_doc is the object document
  SchemaDefinition schema

  // Creator is the DID of the creator
  string creator

  // Timestamp is the time of the last update of the DID Document
  int64 timestamp

  // IsActive is the status of the DID Document
  bool is_active

  // collection of user defined items indended for indexing purposes
  map<string,string> metadata
}
```
below is an example `WhatIs`

```json
"what_is": {
  "did": "did:snr:QmZcUASaA9J7KPDpM7NzpnhvTkdpf5t4DrKEGerKtGwKyd",
  "creator": "did:snr:1z7elmmwqem0ttd707m9sceuqlqz3w4mxqaxydf",
  "schema": {
    "label": "Profile",
    "did": "did:snr:QmZcUASaA9J7KPDpM7NzpnhvTkdpf5t4DrKEGerKtGwKyd",
    "creator": "snr1z7elmmwqem0ttd707m9sceuqlqz3w4mxqaxydf",
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "user",
        "field": 4
      },
      {
        "name": "email",
        "field": 4
      },
      {
        "name": "timestamp",
        "field": 2
      },
      {
        "name": "lastSeen",
        "field": 2
      },
      {
        "name": "message",
        "field": 4
      },
      {
        "name": "isOnline",
        "field": 1
      }
    ]
  },
  "timestamp": 1663184793,
  "is_active": true
}
```


Currently a schema cannot be modified once it has been created. To Modify A Schema, create a new Schema.

### Schema Definition

A `Schema Definition` is used to describe an application Schema that will be stored for later assertion against. The provided `Schema Definition` is then used to Derive both the `WhatIs` that will be recorded on chain. Schemas comply to the `IPLD Object` specification.

```go
message SchemaDefinition{
  // did of the WhatIs
  string did

  // The Account Address signing this message
  string creator

  // Identifier or description of the schema
  string label
  
  LinkKind linkKind;

  // collection of schemaKindDefinitions for construction of the schema
  list<SchemaKindDefinition> fields
}
```

---

### Schema Kind Definition

Schema's declare the intended type of a property though IPLD Type `KIND` Each `KIND` is mapped to the name of a property. Each property defined must map to one of the given `IPLD` `KINDS`

Fields contained within the `SchemaDefinition` are described below:
Each field represents a `IPLD` Kind. More information can be found [here](https://ipld.io/docs/schemas/features/typekinds/).

We currently support the following `types`, and are working to comply with the full `IPLD` type system to support types beyond those listed.

```go
  LIST
  BOOL
  INT
  FLOAT
  STRING
  BYTES
  LINK
```

The following are the numeric values which are used in our `protocol` layers.

| Kind | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
|List| 0|
|Boolean  | 1 | 
|Integer| 2 |
|Float| 3 |
|String | 4 |
|Bytes | 5 |
| Link | 6 | 

# `Link` types and combining Schemas

A `Link` refers to a schema by `DID` which allows users to reuse schemas as properties on other schema definitions. Here we will model a simple schema with nested content.

**Example**

```json
{
  "name": "foo",
  "field": LINK
},
```

`Link` is a `DID` pointing to the following schema

```json
{
  "bar": STRING
}
```

Below is an `Object` using the schema with the **foo** field defined above:

```json
{
  "foo": {
    "bar": "hello-world"
  }
}
```

**Note:** You can not have a `LIST` of `LINK`types.

### Examples

The following are example Schemas and [Objects](/docs/reference/modules/objects.md) which outline how types declared within a schema map to the objects which are defined from them. Below are two examples: An `User Status`, and a `Pet`.

The following is an example schema for a `User Status`

```json
{
"fields": [
			{
				"name": "user",
				"field": STRING
			},
			{
				"name": "email",
				"field": STRING
			},
			{
				"name": "timestamp",
				"field": INT
			},
			{
				"name": "lastSeen",
				"field": INT
			},
			{
				"name": "message",
				"field": STRING
			},
			{
				"name": "isOnline",
				"field": BOOL
			}
		]
}
```

Below is a user status object defined by the above schema

```json
{
  "username": "snr1d8cjuwkssr9uzf8zllkmmn0ekv6p7a7yuz2dp",
  "email": "example@example.com",
  "timestamp": 1662057099,
  "lastSeen": 1661220968,
  "message": "This is my email!"
}
```

---

The following is an example schema for a `Pet`

##### Schema

```json
{
  "name": STRING,
  "breed": STRING,
  "age": INT,
  "owner": STRING
}
```

Below is a pet object defined by the above schema

##### Object

```json
{
  "name": "Fido",
  "breed": "Domestic-Short-Hair",
  "age": 5,
  "owner": "snr1d8cjuwkssr9uzf8zllkmmn0ekv6p7a7yuz2dpc"
}
```

## Usage

The schema module has been integrated in the Sonr [Motor SDK](/docs/guides/overview.mdx) implementations since `v0.3.9`.

- See [Speedway](/docs/reference/speedway/cli.mdx) documentation on usage of DIDs through our management tooling.
- See [Motor-SDK](/docs/guides/data/schemas.mdx) documentation in our SDK targets.
- Read [ADR-2](https://github.com/sonr-io/sonr/blob/dev/docs/architecture/2.md) for a more in depth technical explanation of the design decisions made for the schema module.
