## Core Features

### Verifiable User Identity

Our base DID (or decentralized identifier) follows a syntactic structure of the **root** (your DID), followed by a **method** (or in our case, in every case with this SDK, Sonr), then followed by a **public key**. For more information regarding the Sonr registry module [read here](/docs/reference/modules/registry.mdx).

### Realtime Peer to Peer Network

Our network is built upon `LibP2P`, a peer to peer communication protocol. This allows Highway Nodes and Motor nodes to transmit data, share files, and locate one another. Each motor node in our network is assigned a `DHT` address which allows for unique addressing of each motor in our application network.

### IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication)

IBC can be implemented by any consensus algorithm that supports cheaply verifiable finality with any state machine that supports vector commitments. IBC defines a set of low-level primitives for authentication, transport, and ordering, and a set of application-level standards for asset & data semantics. Ledgers which support compatible standards can be connected together without any special permissions.

## Why Sonr?

Sonr's decentralized realtime network provides Web3 developers with a tool-set that makes it possible to quickly deploy scalable Web3 applications with verifiable data that can be reused and shared across all Sonr powered applications.

### Developer Experience

We believe application development should be as straight forward as possible. Sonr's SDK's is an all-in-one solution for developing applications for the Sonr network. We believe in consistency and openness, as our libraries are built on open standards.

### Verifiable Identities

Each domain registered is backed by a `Decentralized Identifier (DID)` which is unique on our network for your domain name. This identifier is paired with a public key credential which creates your unique profile. Your `DID` is written on our blockchainâ€™s ledger. This ledger is open to all and fully auditable.

### Composable by Design

Our protocols are flexible and are capable of wrapping custom protocols. These protocols are extendable and support merging, which allows for reusability and composability.
