## Why Sonr?

Sonr's decentralized realtime network provides Web3 developers with a tool-set that makes it possible to quickly deploy scalable Web3 applications with verifiable data that can be reused and shared across all Sonr powered applications.

- **Developer Experience** -- We believe application development should be as straight forward as possible. Sonr's SDK's is an all-in-one solution for developing applications for the Sonr network. We believe in consistency and openness, as our libraries are built on open standards.
- **Composable by Design** -- Our protocols are flexible and are capable of wrapping custom protocols. These protocols are extendable and support merging, which allows for reusability and composability.

## Features

### Verifiable User Identity

Our base DID (or decentralized identifier) follows a syntactic structure of the **root** (your DID), followed by a **method** (or in our case, in every case with this SDK, Sonr), then followed by a **public key**. For more information regarding the Sonr registry module [read here](/docs/reference/modules/registry.mdx).

### Realtime Peer to Peer Network

Our network is built upon `LibP2P`, a peer to peer communication protocol. This allows Highway Nodes and Motor nodes to transmit data, share files, and locate one another. Each motor node in our network is assigned a `DHT` address which allows for unique addressing of each motor in our application network.

### IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication)

IBC can be implemented by any consensus algorithm that supports cheaply verifiable finality with any state machine that supports vector commitments. IBC defines a set of low-level primitives for authentication, transport, and ordering, and a set of application-level standards for asset & data semantics. Ledgers which support compatible standards can be connected together without any special permissions.

## Components

Sonr provides a tool-set that gives an end-to-end developer experience for building user-centric, and privacy-preserving decentralized apps. The structure of a Sonr powered App can be broken down into two main parts: the **Application Layer** and the **Blockchain Layer**.

## Blockchain Layer

The blockchain layer is the core of the Sonr platform. It is a decentralized, permissionless, and open-source blockchain that is built on top of the Cosmos SDK. It is a highly scalable and secure blockchain that is designed to be interoperable over the overall IBC network.

Within the Sonr ecosystem, the blockchain by design is a _**persistent pointer record store**_. This means that every piece of data , _excluding DID Documents_, is stored off-chain and cryptographically authorized using a resolver. Our team has embedded these resolvers within all of our Motor libraries.

Developers can quickly interface over the Sonr Modules, and design their App's configuration using the [Speedway CLI](/docs/reference/speedway/cli)

## Application Layer

The central component in every Sonr App is the Motor Node. The motor node abstracts away complex Networking, Blockchain, and Cryptographic methods into a streamlined developer API.

The motor node provides fundamental resolver methods for the Blockchain layer while also:

- Generating and loading a MPC Web3 Wallet
- Enabling Local Device Discovery
- Peer-to-peer data transmission
- HNS Domain Resolution
- ... and much more!
