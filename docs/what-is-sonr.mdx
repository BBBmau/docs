Imagine a world where you can sign up to get a driver's license for the
internet. This driver's license would be encrypted on the Sonr network
blockchain retaining a record book of all your devices and data quickly
guaranteeing you universal validity. Only you will be able to access your record
book with your driverâ€™s license.

When signing into a traditional application you have probably been asked to sign in with Google or Facebook. Your internet driverâ€™s license would be able to sign you in just as easily!

But beyond sign-in, your driverâ€™s license could directly contact every other driverâ€™s license on earth in real-time allowing you to exchange files, money, messages, contracts, and anything digital with other driverâ€™s licenses. Since your driverâ€™s license would be encrypted on a blockchain your exchanges will become quicker and more secure than typical cloud storage that is prone to hacks.

Soon you wonâ€™t even have to imagine it!ðŸš€

# How it works

Sonr decentralizes application databases, making data universally composable and reusable across applications. The network consists of three core parts: &#x20;

- Highly-scalable, decentralized infrastructure for data availability and consensus,&#x20;

- Marketplace of community-created data models

- Suite of standard APIs for storing, updating, and retrieving data from those models.

# Fundamental Building Blocks

1.  Verifiable User Identity

2.  Realtime Peer-to-Peer Network

3.  Permission-less Application Hub

4.  IBC Enabled Blockchain

5.  Object Storage (Data)

6.  Blob Storage (Files)

7.  (Location based discovery) (Device Discovery)

# Verifiable User Identity

Our base DID (or decentralized identifier) follows a syntactic structure of the **root** (your DID), followed by a **method** (or in our case, in every case with this SDK, Sonr), then followed by a **public key**

![DID and channel schema](https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/YigsjtwFFq_eX7dhChoeN/ze9buUbapxPP7S5ROVXn__6e60b2d-screenshot2022-03-10at25108pm.png)

# Realtime Peer to Peer Network

Our network is build upon `libp2p` a peer to peer communication protocol. This allows Highway Nodes and Motor nodes to transmit data, share files, and locate one another. Each motor node in our network is assigned a `DHT` address which allows for unique addressing of each motor in our application network.

# IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication)

IBC can be implemented by any consensus algorithm that supports cheaply verifiable finality with any state machine that supports vector commitments. IBC defines a set of low-level primitives for authentication, transport, and ordering, and a set of application-level standards for asset & data semantics. Ledgers which support compatible standards can be connected together without any special permissions.

# Why Sonr?

Sonr's decentralized realtime network provides Web3 developers with a tool-set that makes it possible to quickly deploy scalable Web3 applications with verifiable data that can be reused and shared across all Sonr powered applications.

### Developer Experience

We believe application development should be as straight forward as possible. Sonr's SDK's is an all-in-one solution for developing applications for the Sonr network. We believe in consistency and openness, our libraries are built on open standards.

### Verifiable Identities

Each domain registered is backed by a Decentralized Identifier (DID) which is unique on our network for your domain name. This identifier is paired with a public key credential which creates your unique profile. Your `did` is written on our block chains ledger. This ledger is open to all and fully auditable.

### Composable by Design

Our protocols are flexible and are capable of wrapping custom protocols, These protocols are extendable, and support merging allowing for reusability and composability.
