The internet today is governed by centralized entities, that control everything from our data to our digital identities. Sonr is designing the internet of tomorrow, where you have true ownership over your data and identity online.

## How it Works

The Sonr network is collectively made up of motor nodes, which act as clients and represent end-users, and highway nodes, the Sonr networkâ€™s servers for data transmission.

- **Real-time peer-to-peer network:** To enable cross-device discovery, delivery, and transmission, Sonr leverages the `LibP2P` framework. With `LibP2P` nodes in the Sonr network can dial other nodes in the network to exchange messages using various transports, like QUIC, TCP, WebSocket, and Bluetooth. Nodes can run on any device, as a cloud service, mobile application or in the browser and talk to each other as long as they are connected on the Sonr network.

- **Verifiable user identity:** Sonr enables verifiable on-chain identity verification via its implementation of the DID specification. Access to this experience is unlocked via procurement of a .snr subdomain. This subdomain gives users one central point of access for being able to securely store user data on the blockchain.

**Example:** Prad secures the prad.snr subdomain. If he wants to access _Netflicks_, a blockchain-based movie recommendation platform built on the Sonr blockchain, he can access his data at prad.snr/Netflicks and also grant other nodes access to his data.

### Verifiable User Identity

Our base DID (or decentralized identifier) follows a syntactic structure of the **root** (your DID), followed by a **method** (or in our case, in every case with this SDK, Sonr), then followed by a **public key**. For more information regarding the Sonr registry module [read here](/docs/highway/modules/registry.md).

### Realtime Peer to Peer Network

Our network is build upon `libp2p` a peer to peer communication protocol. This allows Highway Nodes and Motor nodes to transmit data, share files, and locate one another. Each motor node in our network is assigned a `DHT` address which allows for unique addressing of each motor in our application network.

### IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication)

IBC can be implemented by any consensus algorithm that supports cheaply verifiable finality with any state machine that supports vector commitments. IBC defines a set of low-level primitives for authentication, transport, and ordering, and a set of application-level standards for asset & data semantics. Ledgers which support compatible standards can be connected together without any special permissions.

## Why Sonr?

Sonr's decentralized realtime network provides Web3 developers with a tool-set that makes it possible to quickly deploy scalable Web3 applications with verifiable data that can be reused and shared across all Sonr powered applications.

### Developer Experience

We believe application development should be as straight forward as possible. Sonr's SDK's is an all-in-one solution for developing applications for the Sonr network. We believe in consistency and openness, our libraries are built on open standards.

### Verifiable Identities

Each domain registered is backed by a Decentralized Identifier (DID) which is unique on our network for your domain name. This identifier is paired with a public key credential which creates your unique profile. Your `did` is written on our block chains ledger. This ledger is open to all and fully auditable.

### Composable by Design

Our protocols are flexible and are capable of wrapping custom protocols, These protocols are extendable, and support merging allowing for reusability and composability.
