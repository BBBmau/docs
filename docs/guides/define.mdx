### Define your problem ðŸ‘¤

Consider the questions below when defining your problem and user scenario.

1. **User Need** - Who is my end-user? What problem are they trying to solve? 
2. **Business Viability** - What are the business incentives around this scenario? 
3. **Technical feasibility** - Is this problem solvable given my technical constraints? What type of technology might I need? 

### Design your solution  ðŸ’»

To aid you in designing a Sonr-powered solution, we suggest thinking of your application in two main parts: the **Application Layer** and the **Blockchain Layer**.

#### Application Layer

Use the defined problem and user scenario to inform your applications business logic and user interface. Leverage [Sonr's tools](/docs/tools/speedway/install) which abstract away complex Networking, Blockchain, and Cryptographic methods so you can focus on core business logic. Try our [pre-built widgets](https://motor.build/topics/Widgets-topic.html).

#### Blockchain Layer

Sonr enables your application to interact with the Sonr blockchain via our Motor SDKs.
As a developer, consider the following questions when thinking through the Sonr Modules your application might leverage. 

1. **Registry** - What will my application's login and authorization flow look like? 
2. **Schemas** - What type of data will I need? How will I define that data? 
3. **Documents** - When and how will instances of my defined schema get created?
4. **Buckets** - How will I group and store my Documents? 

### Test and Refine

Continue to iterate on your application based on user feedback. In some cases, you may need to redefine your problem and user scenario based on new market information and trends. Our Speedway tool will support you in continuously improving your application post-launch.
