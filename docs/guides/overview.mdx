Sonr provides a tool-set that gives an end-to-end developer experience for building user-centric, and privacy-preserving decentralized apps. The structure of a Sonr powered App can be broken down into two main parts: the **Application Layer** and the **Blockchain Layer**.

## Blockchain Layer

The blockchain layer is the core of the Sonr platform. It is a decentralized, permissionless, and open-source blockchain that is built on top of the Cosmos SDK. It is a highly scalable and secure blockchain that is designed to be interoperable over the overall IBC network.

Within the Sonr ecosystem, the blockchain by design is a _**persistent pointer record store**_. This means that every piece of data , _excluding DID Documents_, is stored off-chain and cryptographically authorized using a resolver. Our team has embedded these resolvers within all of our Motor libraries.

Developers can quickly interface over the Sonr Modules, and design their App's configuration using the [Speedway CLI](/docs/reference/speedway/cli)

## Application Layer

The central component in every Sonr App is the Motor Node. The motor node abstracts away complex Networking, Blockchain, and Cryptographic methods into a streamlined developer API.

The motor node provides fundamental resolver methods for the Blockchain layer while also:

- Generating and loading a MPC Web3 Wallet
- Enabling Local Device Discovery
- Peer-to-peer data transmission
- HNS Domain Resolution
- ... and much more!
