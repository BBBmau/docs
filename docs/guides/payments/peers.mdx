### ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§

[`motor_flutter`](https://pub.dev/packages/motor_flutter) is a Flutter package for the Sonr Motor Node which provides a reactive property which can be listened to as a stream to identify nearby peers similar to AirDrop.
This mechanism is utilizing the Motor [`DiscoveryProtocol`](/protodocs/service/v1/discover.proto) and is considered experimental. For more information, see the [`nearby_peers`](https://pub.dev/documentation/motor_flutter/latest/motor_flutter/MotorFlutter/nearbyPeers.html) property
of the plugin.
