If a user has previously created an account on the device, they can log in without a password. Alternatively, if the user's pre-shared key has been added to the device, they may login for the first time using a password.

Logs in to an existing account with the given `password`. During production, this method retrieves the keys from the keychain using `address`. Both of these params are required in order
to return a successful [LoginResponse](/protodocs/motor/v1/response.proto#loginresponse).

### Parameters

- `address` - The address of the account to login to.
- `password` - The password used to encrypt the wallet shards with AES.
- `pskKey` - The pre-shared key used to encrypt the wallet shards with AES. _(optional)_
- `dscKey` - The data signing key used to encrypt the wallet shards with AES. _(optional)_

```dart
import 'package:motor_flutter/motor_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final res = await MotorFlutter.to.login(password: 'terrible-password-123', did: 'did:snr:abc123');
  if (res == null) {
    throw Exception('Login failed');
  }
  print('Account logged in successfully: ${res.address}');
}
```

From here we can proceed to **Connect to the Sonr network.**

```dart
import 'package:motor_flutter/motor_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  // Call the Connect method on an already initialized MotorFlutter instance
  await MotorFlutter.to.connect();
}
```

Login creates a motor node from a LoginRequest
:::note
When performing a `Login` operation, an optional password can be provided but is not required.
If a password is not provided, the operating system keychain will be used to load a `Private shared key` containing the passphrase.
:::

```go
func Login(instance *motorNodeImpl, pskKey []byte, acctPassword string, acctAddress string) {
  req := mt.LoginRequest{
          Did: acctAddress,
          Password: acctPassword,
  }

  response, err := instance.Login(req)
  if err != nil {
    // handle error
  }

  fmt.Println(instance.getAddress())
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Next Steps

- Define a new blockchain verifiable data model using [`publishSchema()`](/docs/guides/data/schemas)
- Buy a .snr/ subdomain to simplify your account address using [`buyAlias()`](/docs/guides/auth/alias#buying-an-alias)
- Connect to the p2p network and enable secure device-to-devce communication with [`connect()`](/docs/guides/setup#start-the-motor-node)
